# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This is a clone of the AirBnB web application. The goal of this project is to build a simplified version of the AirBnB platform, implementing core features such as user authentication, property listings, booking functionality, and more.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts behind web application architecture.
- Practice building a full-stack application from scratch.
- Gain experience in collaborative software development using Git and GitHub.
- Understand the roles and responsibilities in a software development team.

## Team Roles

Below are the key roles involved in this project and their responsibilities:

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the core application logic, server-side APIs, and integration with the database. Uses Python (Flask/Django) to manage the business logic of the platform.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database schema, ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and handles migrations and backups. Works closely with backend developers.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
Focuses on deployment, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and server monitoring. Ensures that the development and production environments are stable and scalable.

### 4. QA Engineer
Tests the application for bugs, usability, performance, and security. Ensures a reliable and smooth user experience before deployment.
